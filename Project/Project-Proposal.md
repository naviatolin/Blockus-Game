# Project Proposal

We plan on creating a Blokus game where people,  not computers, can play against each other. We will explore pygame as a tool for creating this tile based game. As a minimum viable product we will create a user interface that allows someone to place a Blokus tile on a board such that the rules of the game are observed. As a reach, we will be able to change the shape of the board and the shape of the tiles depending on how many people are playing. We are aiming to have people who love Blokus but keep losing their pieces play the game. People without a computer who want to play our game will need to go their local library, which could pose some accessibility issues. People who prefer to play Blokus with real pieces will probably not want to play our game.

We plan on using pygame to do this project. Also, numpy.

As we go through our project, we want to keep our individual learning goals in mind.

There are some risks we see in taking on this project. First, there are many states which we will need to keep track of, such as the status of each square on the board and the number of pieces owned by each player. We also see the difficulties of making the user interface intuitive as a significant challenge. 

Navi:

- Learn how to integrate pictures with python code
- Make a modular game
- Write more code without going to stackoverflow
- Get better at commiting changes frequently

Shawn: 

- Start early enough that I don't just settle on the MVP
- Figure out how to balance writing new code with using existing code â†’ making the most efficient use of new libraries
- Good code practices with two people

### Timeline

By Class 1: Play around with pygame using the tutorials provided. 

By Class 2: Startup screen that goes to a game, click and drag for the pieces (flip/rotate/drag)

By Class 3: Legal move detection (only allows legal moves), not allowing pieces to be moved after a turn has gone by, counter for pieces

By Class 4: Add three player extension where board changes shape, becomes spooky themed.
